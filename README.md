SCOPE OF THE PROJECT 

• People are warned prior to what the weather will be like on a particular day.
 • To help people take proper precautions to secure themselves and their families in case of unwanted occurrences. • Organizations can work better with the help of accurate weather predictions.
 • It helps to deliver visual forecasts by various methods that most companies prefer.
 • Weather forecasting highly benefits the agriculture sector for buying/selling livestock.
 • It also assists the farmers to decide when to plant crops, pastures, and when to irrigate. Because having a system that tells you the soil is dry but you don’t need to irrigate because it is going to rain after a few hours seems to be an interesting use case. Isn’t it? 
• It is the best method for management of inventory, selling strategies and crop forecasts.
 • It provides the business with valuable information that the business can use to make decisions about future business strategies.

 OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT 
 
The objectives of this project are
  To examine the applicability of Neural Network approach by developing effective and efficient predictive models for weather analysis for, India. 
 To develop an efficient, reliable, and effective weather forecasting system based on Artificial Neural Network, Decision Tree Algorithm and Random Forest Algorithm. 
 To compare and evaluate the performance of above models and the programming was carried out using PYTHON as a tool.  Our project aims to predict the Weather and Atmosphere conditions using the previous dataset of the weather forecasting with a focus on improving the accuracy of prediction. This will increase the accuracy of the weather prediction and we will get accurate results than the traditional methods. Our dataset consists of max and min. temperature of everyday from the specific location. 

 Classifications:
 • When gathering datasets to give to the models there are sure parameters which are called as ordered information which incorporates: snow, rainstorm, rain, mist, cloudy, for the most part overcast, halfway shady, scattered mists, and clear. These can be additionally ordered into four classes. 
1. Rain, tempest, and snow into precipitation 
2. For the most part shady, foggy, and cloudy into exceptionally shady 
3. Scattered mists and somewhat shady into modestly shady 
4. Clear as clear 
Thus, our aim is to provide accurate result in order to provide correct prediction of weather for future so in critical conditions people can be aware of upcoming natural calamities. 


PROPERTIES OF THE PROJECT 
There are several reasons why weather forecasts are important. They would certainly be missed if they were not there. It is a product of science that impacts the lives of many people. The following is a list of various reasons why weather forecasts are important: 
1. Helps people prepare for how to dress (i.e., warm weather, cold weather, windy weather, rainy weather) 
2. Helps businesses and people plan for power production and how much power to use (i.e. power companies, where to set thermostat)
 3. Helps people prepare if they need to take extra gear to prepare for the weather (i.e. umbrella, rain coat, sun screen)
 4. Helps people plan outdoor activities (i.e., to see if rain/storms/cold weather will impact outdoor event)
 5. Helps curious people to know what sort of weather can be expected (i.e., a snow on the way, severe storms)
 6. Helps businesses plan for transportation hazards that can result from the weather (i.e., fog, snow, ice, storms, clouds as it relates to driving and flying for example)
 7. Helps people with health-related issues to plan the day (i.e., allergies, asthma, heat stress) 8. Helps businesses and people plan for severe weather and other weather hazards (lightning, hail, tornadoes, hurricanes, ice storms)
